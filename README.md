## How It Works

1. Recruiter registers & logs in
2. Creates a new test with minimal input (job role, topic, number of questions etc.)
3. Gemini generates relevant test questions
4. The test is stored in Firebase
5. Recruiter assigns the test to the candidate(s)
6. Candidate completes the test via their portal
7. Gemini evaluates answers and updates scores in real-time
8. Both the candidate and the recruiter can see test results
